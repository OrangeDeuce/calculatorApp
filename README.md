Adapted partially from @betomoedano but also updated my own tweaks with some new modifications + various additional features:
- [x] Display all user button presses (Both numbers and operations) in secondary display 
- [x] Insert dark mode/light mode icon at Switch



## Run / Deploy Steps
Open Terminal
```
npm start
```
